# DeepGenerativeAttack

This is the code for ICJB 2024 paper Deep Generative Attacks and Countermeasures for Data-Driven Writer-Dependent Static Signature Verification. 

# Generation process

As discussed in the paper, we used CGAN and VAE to generate synthetic signatures. The codes included in this repository is made for the CEDAR dataset from https://cedar.buffalo.edu/handwriting/HRdatabase.html. Make sure to check the required paths for the files. 

To run generation with, run file CGAN generation. The same with VAE generation. For controlled SSIM generation with VAE as discussed in the paper, see the VAE SSI file.
